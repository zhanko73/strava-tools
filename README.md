strava-tools
============

Library for web-scraping Strava data.

> This library became as a fork from [loisaidasam/stravalib-scraper](https://github.com/loisaidasam/stravalib-scraper) with some extentions
> - a shell
> - load following activity feed
> - **send batch kudos**
> - display / filter activities

Note: Strava does have a [developer portal](https://developers.strava.com/) complete with a proper API and examples. This web-scraping based library is written to complete the lack of feature of the standard API. Accessing Friends' acitivities and interations with them like kudoing.
